# Abstract

*Swifty View Controller Presenters*

> One major shortcoming of UIKit is that view controllers have too many responsibilities. This talk focuses on one — presenting and dismissing view controllers — and how we can re-examine and redefine the presentation controller API in iOS with a more Swifty API that reduces boilerplate and increases expressivity.
