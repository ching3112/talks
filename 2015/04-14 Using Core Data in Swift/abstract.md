# Abstract

*Using Core Data in Swift*

> Core Data is probably loved as much as it is shunned by iOS developers. No matter its pros and cons, it remains a popular choice for many iOS developers as Apple continues to invest in it. Core Data is a framework of great power that often comes with great frustration. When using Swift, we can make Core Data more powerful, and sometimes more frustrating. This talk presents practical strategies for moving away from an Objective-C model, the bugs you'll run into and how to work around them, how Swift can bring clarity to your model objects, and how to harness Swift features in your NSManagedObject subclasses.
